## Project Description

This project is a Java-based Vehicle Management System that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It consists of several components:

- A hierarchy of engine classes (`Engine`, `CombustionEngine`, `ElectricEngine`, and `HybridEngine`) to represent different types of vehicle engines.
- The `Manufacture` class for tracking manufacturing information.
- A superclass `Vehicle` with abstract methods, and three subclasses (`ICEV`, `BEV`, and `HybridV`) representing different types of vehicles.
- A main program to create and display vehicle characteristics.

## Development Environment

- **Programming Language**: Java
